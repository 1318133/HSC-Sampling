Schematic diagram of the principal differences between universal sampling and proposed Heterospectral Structure Compensation Sampling (HSC-Sampling). The error maps are obtained by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each individual band and aggregating these band-wise error measurements. The visual discrepancy between the two error maps demonstrates that the images generated using the HSC-Sampling method are significantly superior to those produced by universal sampling approaches.
